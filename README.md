# 2048.net
2048 game in .Net and Xamarin Forms.

Based on [Gabriele Cirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli)'s great [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) by porting the game flow Javascript code to C# and implementing UX in [Xamarin Forms](https://www.xamarin.com/forms).

Maybe, one day, to be published in all the stores there are.

Feel free to suggest or contribute.

##Future features:
* Add start menu with options:
  * Multiple grid sizes
  * Game modes:
    * Continous (scored with high score)
    * Timed (fihish as fast as possible)
* Implement Web Service to share high scores between players
* ...whatever I might come up with or am suggested, in the meantime...

Tested in the following platforms:
* Windows 10 Desktop
* Windows 10 Mobile
* Windows 10 IoT (Raspeberry Pi 3)
