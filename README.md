# 2048.net
2048 game in .Net and Xamarin Forms.

Based on [Gabriele Cirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli)'s great [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) by porting the game flow Javascript code to C# and implementing UX in [Xamarin Forms](https://www.xamarin.com/forms).

Maybe, one day, to be published in all the stores there are.

Feel free to suggest or contribute.

Future features:
* Store game state and scores locally
* Add start menu with multiple size boards options
* Implement Web Service to share high scores between players
* ...whatever I might come up with or am suggested, in the meantime...
